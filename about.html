      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Yume Private Server</strong> is a fan-made, custom-hosted Growtopia server created with love and vision by <strong>iLitz_</strong>.
        Our mission is to bring players a unique experience beyond the limits of the original game — one built with community, creativity, and fun.

      <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
      <p>
        Yume isn't just another Growtopia clone. It’s a re-imagined server that values fairness, customization, and innovation. We’ve
        introduced tweaks and features not found in the original Growtopia, while still keeping that nostalgic sandbox charm.
